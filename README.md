# RGB Color Guessing Game
This was a small project from Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp from Udemy.  A lot of the focus was on 
the logic/functionality with Javascript and definitely helped re-enforce what I already knew.  As opposed to coding along directly with Colt, I was able to pause the tutorials several times and write out the logic without help.  I used the lessons as ways to check my work.  

## Things I added

* Colt used Floats to layout the color boxes, I opted for CSS Grid.
* More to come here...
